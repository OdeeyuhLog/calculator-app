# calculator-app

Here is a simple calculator web application made with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This calculator evaluates a single pair of numbers per calculation. (Just how the ol' markket calculators work)
This app also consists of reset and backspace feature.
Final Project for the Foundations curriculum of TOP.
