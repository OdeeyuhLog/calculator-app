# calculator-app

Here is a simple calculator web application made with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This calculator evaluates a single pair of numbers per calculation. (Just how the ol' markket calculators work)
This app also consists of reset and backspace feature.
Final Project for the Foundations curriculum of TOP.

P.S Was very hard to work with and took a week too. The confusing part was how to store the two number values input and 
how to dynamically change operands and operators.
